# _WelterKit_ - My personal collection of .NET utilities code.

--- This is pre-release software! ---

## Consists of three libraries (currently):

- ### WelkerKit.Std

  The bulk of the library code; covers a wide gamut of topics and will probably get broken down into separate libraries moving forward.

  Targets _.NET Standard 2.1_.

- ### WelkerKit

  Updates and additions that require newer features of .NET.

  _Targets .NET 6.0_.

- ### WelkerKit.Testing

  Utilities to aid with automated testing / unit tests.
